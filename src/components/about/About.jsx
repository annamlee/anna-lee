            <p>i am currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in
                computer science and minoring in business economics, with a keen
                interest in building user-oriented applications and utilizing the 
                curious power of code to solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>when i'm not in the computer world, i enjoy exploring new places, going
                to concerts, grabbing boba, reading, and playing the guitar.
