            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>I am currently a third year undergraduate student majoring in
                Computer Science and minoring in Business Economics, with a keen
                interest in building user-oriented applications and utilizing the 
                curious power of code to solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not in the computer world, I enjoy exploring new places, going
                to concerts, grabbing boba, reading, and playing the guitar.
            </p>
